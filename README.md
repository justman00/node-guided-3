# Express Middleware

Guided project for **Node API 3** module.

In this project we will learn how to create a very simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`, and learn to use and create `Express Middleware`.

## Prerequisites

- a REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.

## Project Setup

- [ ] Clone the repository to your local
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned the repo
- [ ] Type `npm install` to download dependencies

Please follow along as the instructor creates and adds `middleware` to the API step by step.

## Types of middlewares
- builtin (`express.json()`)
- external middlewares (`morgan middleware`) - NPM
- custom middlewares - `authorization`, `authentication`, `cache`
- error middleware
